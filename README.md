# Mind-Matters

## Overview : 
Mind Matters is a comprehensive project developed as part of Semester 6 coursework, aimed at offering a holistic solution to mental health, anxiety disorders and stress management. With a range of modules designed to provide insights, psychometric tools, and support, Mind Matters strives to promote mental well-being and offer practical solutions for individuals seeking assistance.

## Modules : 

1. **Anxiety Prediction** - Utilizing the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale which is used clinically by psychiatrists world-wide, this module predicts anxiety levels based on responses to a 50-question test. A threshold value predicts if an individual has anxiety. 

2. **Understanding Anxiety Disorders Parameters** - This module offers in-depth insights into different parameters of anxiety disorders. Implementing a research paper around decision theoretic analysis, this module aims to foster a better understanding of decision making of an individual during mental health issues. 

3. **Breathe Matters** - Your virtual yoga guru, this module provides guided breathing exercises to promote relaxation and stress relief. Through simple yet effective practices, users can learn to regulate their breathing and cultivate a sense of calm amidst daily challenges.

4. **Stress Matters** - Addressing the pervasive issue of stress, this module predicts the stress levels of an indivudual based on various vital parameters of the body. In addition, it also gives insights to the users about how different body parameters are contributing to the stress levels through visualisation. 

5. **Therapy Matters** - Introducing Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy as a module, it provides users with a bilateral simulation, virtual therapeutic approach for managing trauma and anxiety-related disorders.
   
6. **Blogging Matters** - Creating a safe space for users to share their experiences, insights, and coping strategies through blogging. This module aims to foster a supportive community and promote mental health awareness through shared narratives.
   
7. **Mind Matters Chat Buddy** - This integrated chatbot provides accessible and immediate support to individuals seeking assistance. It is not a substitute for professional mental health care, just a supplementary service in moments of distress.
